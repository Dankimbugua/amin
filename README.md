## What it is:
This is a nice little project for a short video meant to ease some tension off the Izzy-Pally situation.

### How it works:

1. It draws an SVG containing 3 makeshift flags of the 3 Abrahamic religions  
    1.1. Christianity is represented by the Christian cross ✝  
    1.2. Judaism is represented by the star of David ✡  
    1.3. Islam is represented by the Palestinian triangle ▶
3. It morphs the flags/images into the word AMIN
4. As it morphs, it plays the Jerusalem song by Alpha blondy
    > You can see Christians, Jews, and Muslims  
    > Living together and praying Amen
    
5. The reverse plays as the next line of the song plays.
    > Let's gives thanks and praises
6. The play loops again from the start.

### Try it!
* Be sure to enable audio autoplay in your browser e.g.
    * ``chrome.exe --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required``
* The result should look like this:
    * <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90d0922b-5286-4bfe-9c77-96b43c716c90"></video>
